      <small class="text-muted small">This calculator lets the user determine carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions for given combustion fuel, biofuel,
      refrigerant charge, purchased gases, fuel use for transportation, and purchased electricity from the grid.
      Select the emission source type to select the emission from combustion fuel, biofuel, refrigerant charge,
      purchased gases, purchased electricity from the grid. Next select the emission source and corresponding fuel type.
      The emission output rate can be edited but will return to the default value when the electricity/fuel options are
      changed.
      For calculating emission from purchased electricity from the grid select Electricity under Emission Source Type.
      Enter the facilityâ€™s zip code and check that it provides the correct eGrid and GEA regions. Pick the year and type
      of emissions rate. Location-based emissions use the grid-average emission factor (EPA e-GRID factor). The market
      based emission factors are calculated using residual mix from Green-e. The projection emission factors are from
